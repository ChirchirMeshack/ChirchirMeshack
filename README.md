# Hey there, I'm Meshack Kimoloi 👋

![Profile views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=ChirchirMeshack&color=blue&style=flat-square)

I'm a **multi-cloud**, **JavaScript**, **coffee-fueled problem solver** from 🇰🇪.  
Currently building cool stuff at the intersection of **cloud computing**  and *web development** .

🧠 I’m the kind of dev who breaks production *once* and never forgets `--force` again.

> 🚀 Right now: Building a modern SaaS for car wash management (with Next.js, Supabase,  Framer Motion spice, and Tailwind drip), blogging about cool things I do, and staying dangerously curious.

## 📚 Currently Learning & Nerding Out On

My brain's always hungry for new challenges (and probably more RAM)! Here’s the current learning quest log – gotta keep sharp in this ever-changing tech landscape:

* ☁️ **Wrangling the Cloud Beasts:** Deep diving into both **AWS** *and* **Azure**. Why choose one cloud when you can master the beautiful complexity (and unique frustrations) of two? Aiming for full multi-cloud mastery .
* 🔒 **Fortifying the Digital Castle:** Actively exploring Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals. Because building cool stuff is great, but building *secure* cool stuff is even better! Trying not to accidentally `rm -rf` my security posture.
* 💸 **Making Money Move:** Getting intimate with the **M-Pesa Daraja** & **Paystack** APIs. Integrating seamless, local payments is key, 'cause even the coolest SaaS needs to keep the lights on!
* ✨ **Next-Level Frontend Sorcery:** Continuously leveling up my **Next.js** game. Chasing faster load times, slicker animations, and component structures so clean they'd make Kasongo proud.

*It's a marathon, not a sprint...Best of luck. If you're nerding out on any of this too, let's connect!* 🚀

> 📈 On a mission to contribute more to open-source in 2025. Let’s make it happen!

## ✨ Fun Facts & Confessions of a Coder

Because there's more to me than just lines of code (promise!). Here's a peek behind the curtain:

* 🕸️ **Cabling PTSD & Pride:** I've wrestled with network cables in  ceilings like a tech-ninja. That experience taught me patience, the importance of zip ties, and that sometimes, the most tangled problems require a physical layer fix (or just stepping back for a minute).
* 💾 **My Brain's External Hard Drive:** I maintain a very serious, highly confidential Whatsapp channel... with *myself*. It's my digital scrapbook for random code snippets, terminal commands I *always* forget five minutes later, and links to those Stack Overflow answers that felt like divine intervention. Don't tell anyone my secret!
* **Powered by Kenyan Coffee & Curiosity:** My coding sessions are fueled by strong Kenyan coffee and an insatiable curiosity that often leads me down deep tech rabbit holes at 2 AM. Usually involves way too many browser tabs.
